/*
 * K13 ($$) Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).
 *
 * Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly.
 * I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in problem P09,
 * but only count them. As in problem P11, simplify the result list by replacing
 * the singleton terms [1,X] by X.
